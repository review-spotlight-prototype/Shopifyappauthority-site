# DO NOT MODIFY - Protected Site Components

## CRITICAL: Never Modify These Files
- `index.html` (homepage - working and live)
- `privacy-policy/index.html` (required for affiliate programs)
- `terms/index.html` (legal compliance)
- `klaviyo-review/index.html` (established content)
- `recharge-review/index.html` (established content)
- `best-shopify-apps-2025/index.html` (main traffic driver)

## Protected Configuration
- DNS settings and domain configuration
- Cloudflare Pages hosting setup
- Repository structure and folder organization
- Any existing analytics tracking codes
- Affiliate links that are already working

## Safe Modification Areas
- Create NEW review pages in NEW folders only
- Add NEW comparison pages
- Create NEW category hub pages
- Enhance existing pages with additional content (but don't replace core structure)
- Add new images to `/images/` folder

## Before Making Changes
1. Always work in a new branch first
2. Test changes locally before merging
3. Never delete existing working content
4. Preserve all existing affiliate links and tracking
5. Maintain existing page URLs and navigation structure

## Emergency Recovery
If something breaks:
1. Revert to last working commit immediately

3. Verify all affiliate links still work
4. Test mobile responsiveness
