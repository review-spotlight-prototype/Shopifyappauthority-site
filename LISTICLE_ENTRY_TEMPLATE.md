# Listicle Entry Template - Hard-Selling Conversion Format

## Overview
This template documents the proven conversion-focused format developed for app entries in listicles. Based on the successful Klaviyo entry transformation, this approach prioritizes selling over informing, creating urgency and FOMO while maintaining SEO value.

## Entry Structure (Exact Order)

### 1. App Header
```html
<h3>[App Name]</h3>
<div class="app-category">[Category Name]</div>
```
- Use exact app name (brand recognition)
- Category should be descriptive and SEO-friendly

### 2. Hook Description (Pain-First Approach)
```html
<div class="app-description">
    <strong>[Urgent pain point opener].</strong> [Competitor advantage statement]. [Specific consequence of not using this tool].
</div>
```

**Formula:**
- **Opening:** Start with urgent pain ("Stop leaving money on the table")
- **Competition:** Emphasize what competitors are doing while they're not
- **Consequences:** Paint picture of ongoing losses/missed opportunities

**Example:**
> **Stop leaving money on the table.** Every day you're not using Klaviyo is another day your competitors are stealing revenue you should be getting. While you're sending basic emails that get ignored, stores using Klaviyo are automatically recovering abandoned carts, targeting high-value customers, and turning browsers into buyers with surgical precision.

### 3. Visual Element (Optional but Recommended)
```html
<div class="conversion-visual">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 500 120" class="[app-name]-illustration">
        <!-- Conversion flow visualization -->
    </svg>
</div>
```

**Guidelines:**
- Show problem → solution → result flow
- Use brand colors (Shopify green #95BF47 + app colors)
- Include app logo if available
- Keep height to 120px max (500x120 viewBox)
- Make it SEO-friendly and conversion-focused

### 4. Authority Section ("Why I Recommend" → "The Brutal Truth")
```html
<div class="why-i-like">
    <h4>The brutal truth:</h4>
    <p>[Personal experience statement]. [Specific losses/costs]. [Opportunity cost framing]. [Competitive disadvantage consequence].</p>
</div>
```

**Framework:**
- **Personal authority:** "I've watched stores hemorrhage money..."
- **Specific consequences:** "will make you sick when you realize..."
- **Opportunity cost:** "Every [action] you [do] is an opportunity cost..."
- **Competitive pressure:** "Your customers are getting [better experience] elsewhere"

### 5. Selling Points (Green Checkmarks)
```html
<div class="selling-points">
    <div class="selling-point">
        <span class="check">✅</span>
        <span class="point-text"><strong>[Benefit headline]</strong> - [Detailed explanation with specifics]</span>
    </div>
    <!-- Repeat 3-4 times -->
</div>
```

**Rules:**
- **Always 4 selling points maximum**
- Lead with benefit, not feature
- Include specific details (numbers, quantities, guarantees)
- No false claims or fabricated ROI data
- Be specific and verifiable

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Start FREE** - No credit card required, forever free plan available. [App] offers a free plan that includes [specific limits/features].
- ✅ **Scales with you** - From $0 to enterprise without switching platforms. [Specific scaling explanation].
- ✅ **Advanced [core feature]** - [Specific automation/capability]. [Detailed explanation of what it includes].
- ✅ **Zero learning curve** - [Ease of use benefit]. [Specific details about templates/simplicity].

### 6. Call-to-Action
```html
<a href="[affiliate-link]" class="cta-button" target="_blank">[Action-oriented CTA with benefit]</a>
```

**CTA Formula:**
- Start with action verb: "Start Converting...", "Begin Automating...", "Stop Losing..."
- Include what they'll achieve: "Emails Into Sales", "Visitors Into Customers"
- End with urgency: "Get [App] Now"

**Example:** "Start Converting Emails Into Sales - Get Klaviyo Now"

## Content Guidelines

### Tone and Voice
- **Urgent and direct:** Create immediate FOMO
- **Authority-based:** Reference real experience managing $100M+ ad spend
- **Brutally honest:** "The brutal truth" framing
- **Competitive pressure:** Emphasize what competitors are doing
- **Consequence-focused:** Paint picture of ongoing losses

### SEO Requirements
- Include app name multiple times naturally
- Use category-relevant keywords
- Include specific features and capabilities
- Mention pricing and plan details when relevant
- Use semantic keywords (automation, conversion, revenue, etc.)

### Compliance Rules
- **NO fabricated data:** No fake ROI percentages, testing claims, or made-up metrics
- **NO false guarantees:** Don't promise specific results
- **Verifiable claims only:** All statements must be factually accurate
- **Honest pricing:** Include real pricing information
- **Proper affiliate disclosure:** Maintain transparency

### Forbidden Elements
- ❌ Fake testing periods ("12 months testing across X stores")
- ❌ Specific ROI numbers ("38:1 ROI", "240% increase")
- ❌ Made-up case studies with fake metrics
- ❌ False guarantees ("guaranteed to increase revenue")
- ❌ Competitor bashing or unfair comparisons
