=== Google Analytics Setup Recommendations ===

1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
   - Review Google Analytics real-time reports to verify tracking
   - Set up custom dimensions in GA4 for page_type and content_category
   - Create audiences based on engagement metrics

2. GA4 CONFIGURATION:
   Go to your GA4 property and configure:

   a) Custom Dimensions (Admin > Custom definitions):
      - page_type (Event parameter)
      - content_category (Event parameter)
      - merchant (Event parameter)

   b) Enhanced Measurement (Admin > Data Streams > Web):
      - Enable all toggles (scrolls, outbound clicks, site search, etc.)

   c) Audiences (Admin > Audiences):
      - High-intent users (scroll > 75%, time > 60s)
      - Review readers (page_type = review)
      - Affiliate clickers (event = affiliate_click)

3. EVENTS TO MONITOR:
   Key events now being tracked:
   - affiliate_click (with merchant details)
   - internal_navigation (user flow)
   - scroll_depth (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 100%)
   - time_on_page (30s, 60s, 120s, 300s)
   - email_signup (form submissions)
   - search_query (site search)
   - Web Vitals (LCP, FID for performance)

4. REFERRAL TRACKING FIX:
   - Linker parameter added for cross-domain tracking
   - Add your domain to referral exclusion list in GA4

5. TESTING:
   - Use GA4 DebugView to see events in real-time
   - Install Google Analytics Debugger Chrome extension
   - Run: GATracking.debugMode(true) in browser console

6. ATTRIBUTION:
   The new setup tracks:
   - Which pages lead to affiliate clicks
   - User journey through your site
   - Content engagement patterns
   - Conversion paths
